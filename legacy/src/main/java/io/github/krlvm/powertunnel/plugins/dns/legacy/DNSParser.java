     * Retrieves is an IP address is an IPv6 address

     * Very dirty implementation, needs to be rewritten
     * That is needed because we support (DNS) both IPv4 and IPv6
     * addresses, and they may have a specified port
     *
     * IPv4 example: 127.0.0.1
     *    with port: 127.0.0.1:8085
     * IPv6 example: ::1
     *    with port: [::1]:8085
     *
     * We will count occurrences of ":" in an address
     *
     * @param address - an IP address
     * @return true if it's IPv6 or false if it is IPv4 (or invalid)
